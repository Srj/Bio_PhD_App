Hello Everyone. I am Saifur. I have joined WashU School of Medicine for my Ph.D in Fall 2024. I believe many others will be applying soon and my experience in the application in a medical school from a pure engineering background for fellow students like me.
That's why I am writing this article to share my experience as well as few suggestions. I hope it will come handy for people who wants to pursue their higher study in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics/Genetics and related field. I will writing this from a 
CS major's perspective but I believe it would be helpful for students from any background. So, let's start.

The first question any PhD applicants would ask is, WHERE SHOULD I APPLY? WHICH SCHOOLS ARE GOOD? As people like order in everything, we grad students are no different. We seek for a ranking in the relevant field and I am no different. As a CS major, the first place
we would go to is [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/) or [USNews CS Rank](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings?_sort=rank-asc). CSRankings has a filter to sort schools according to Comp. Bio. & Binformatics and most people tends to fall to this trap. This is a distraous ranking for this field and let me tell you why. CSRankings ranks school based on publications that are indexed dblp. 

dblp is a well renowned publications index in the field of CS but it does not contain journals like Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Methods or any reputated Nature journals, Science, Cell and all of its journals, PNAS, Genome Research, Genome Biology, Brain and almost all of the top journals in the field of computational biology. If you visit the profile of a big faculty in this field, you will certainly find that they all publishes their work in these and many more top life science journals. CSrankings does NOT take publications in these venues into account! Ironically, with some appropriate filter, you can rank BUET among top 15 school in the world; even above MIT. So, why are you aspiring to go to MIT leaving BUET!

Okay, now back to the main point. Where can we find a reliable list of schools that are top-notch in medical research? Remember that all ranks are flawed! Still, if you want to look for a list of school that are good in computational biology, you can look into the following list to get an idea. 
- [Top NIH grant received Schools](https://www.genengnews.com/a-lists/top-50-nih-funded-institutions-of-2022/)
- [USNews Biological Sciences Rank](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/biological-sciences-rankings)

Before discussing programs into any of the school and share my experiences, I would put a cautionary notes and suggestions first. Please don't apply to CS department if you are planning to come to computational biology. Look for medical schools or CS programs that have joint collaboration with medical schools. When applying you will mostly have options to apply to Computational Biology/Bioinformatics under CS department as well as direct Comp. Bio/Bioinformatics program. I was confused to choose between them and so will be you. Most of the direct Bioinformatics programs are affiliated with Medical School while CS/Bioinformatics are affiliated with Engineering school. But why does it matter? It matters because there is a high chance that there will be no wet lab in the Engineering school and they only analyze data produced by other labs or publicly available while med schools have their own lab and can run end-to-end experiments rather than relying on data produced by others. 

But, I don't want to do wet lab works, I want to sit in front of my desk and analyze the data. I wanted the same to until I had a interview with Mike Province from WashU, who totally changed my idea. No matter where you want to go to after PhD, having both wet and dry lab experience will serve you in the long run. If you are only a anylst, chances are high that you won't be well prepared for a top position in this field cause both academia and industry want people who know to design biological experiments, can decide on appropriate technologies to run the experiment on as well as analyze the data. In an editorial notes by NEJM (*if you are wondering what this journal is, it has an impact factor of 96.2 if this gives you idea on its reputation*), the editors called the bioinformaticians *"research parasite"* because they rely on the data produced by others and have little to no biological knowledge of the data and very often come up with wrong conclusion from the data which can be disastraous. It's always better work in a lab where there is both dry and wet lab and you can always focus on the dry lab part while getting some experience of the wet lab as well. This is the reason I would encourge everyone to apply to medical school rather than engineering program ( some CS professor has their own wet lab, those are exceptions).

My second cautionary note will be to check the requirements for the specific med school programs. Some med schools have hard requirement of double major of biology and math/CS or good enough biology requirement. Do not apply to those schools if you are a CS major as they will not even review your applications as they receive thousands of applications and can only review hundreds of them to accept 10-12 student each year. It would be a waste of your money like I did. If you are really into that school, then you have no other options but to apply to their engineering school.

Enough of cautions, let's discuss some school and program. I will be discussing the top ten or twenty schools from the NIH grants list but by no means I endorse this rank. So, let's start.

**University of California San Fransico**
I am pretty sure, we all are familiar with UC Berkley, UCLA, UC San Diego. Where does UCSF come from? It is a very big name in the biotech industry. We do not know this name because this school is totally focused on biological science and has no engineering program. Look into their program for more details if you are interested but I did not apply here. 

**Johns Hopkins University**
